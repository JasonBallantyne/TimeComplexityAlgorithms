# TimeComplexityAlgorithms
This notebook carries out the following tasks:
1. Writing an algorithm to compute the factorial of a positive integer n.
2. For different values of n, we compute and plot the running time as a function of n for non-tail recursion, tail recursion and an iterative approach.
3. Using a sequence obtained from above, we will be implement the linear search and the iterative binary search methods.
4. For each approach, we will compute the best and worst running times and give examples by plotting running time as a function of n.
5. Use curve fitting algorithms to find the equation of the running times obtained from the previous tasks.
